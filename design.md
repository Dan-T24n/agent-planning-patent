## Evaluator Framework

### Standardized 6-Criteria Evaluation
All evaluators use identical scoring framework from eval.md (1-5 scale with detailed guidelines):

1. **Technical Validity**: Assessment of whether the patented technology can be practically implemented within realistic constraints (1-3 years)
2. **Innovativeness**: Evaluation of how novel and differentiated the patented technology is compared to existing solutions
3. **Specificity**: Assessment of how clearly defined and focused the patent application is in terms of target users and use cases
4. **Need Validity**: Verification that target users have a genuine, pressing need for the solution described in the patent
5. **Market Size**: Assessment of the total addressable market and potential user base for the patented technology
6. **Competitive Advantage**: Evaluation of strategic business benefits and differentiation the patent provides vs competitors

Each criterion follows detailed scoring guidelines:
- **5 - Excellent/Breakthrough**: Highest level achievement in this dimension
- **4 - Good/Strong**: Above average performance with clear benefits
- **3 - Average/Moderate**: Adequate performance meeting basic requirements
- **2 - Poor/Weak**: Below average with significant concerns
- **1 - Unacceptable/No benefit**: Fails to meet minimum standards

## Streamlined Evaluation Process

### Parallel + Sequential Execution in Phase 4
1. **Parallel Evaluation** (3 tasks using same agent):
   - **product_evaluation_pm_task**: Evaluates Product Manager concept using 6-criteria framework
   - **product_evaluation_entrepreneur_task**: Evaluates Serial Entrepreneur concept using 6-criteria framework  
   - **product_evaluation_research_task**: Evaluates Research Commercialization concept using 6-criteria framework
2. **Sequential Selection & Formatting**:
   - **output_summarizer**: Takes all 3 evaluation results, selects winner by highest total score, formats into tasks_nlp.yaml JSON structure

### Decision Criteria
- **Investment Lens**: Market opportunity, competitive advantage, scalability potential
- **Execution Lens**: Technical feasibility, go-to-market strategy, resource requirements
- **Combined Assessment**: Concepts that score well on both investment attractiveness AND execution viability

### Final Output Structure
```yaml
Final JSON Output (tasks_nlp.yaml format):
{
  "publication_number": "US-XXXXXXXXX-A",
  "title": "60-100 character product title",
  "product_description": "200-300 character description with target users, needs, and benefits", 
  "implementation": "200-300 character technical implementation approach",
  "differentiation": "200-300 character unique competitive advantages"
}
