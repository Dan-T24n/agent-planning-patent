product_definition_task:
  description: >
    Using the patent analysis and market research, develop a commercial product concept given by the patent `{publication_number}`.
    Do not use search tool, focus on provided inputs: patent insights and market analysis.
    Utilize all gathered insights to build a product concept with the following structure:
    - product_title: A concise, compelling name for the product, highlighting its technological core (60-100 characters).
    - product_description: Explain the product, its core technology features, target users (informed by research), their needs, and the
      unique benefits derived from its underlying technology (200-300 characters).
    - implementation: Describe how the patent's core technologies would be integrated into the product
      architecture to deliver its key features (200-300 characters).
    - differentiation: Highlight what makes this product unique, supported by your market and USP research. Focus on how its specific
      technological capabilities (e.g., superior accuracy, novel features, efficiency) set it apart

    Examples of output, strictly follow the format.
    Example 1:
    {
      "publication_number": "US-202117564168-A",
      "title": "NameGuard: AI-Powered Access Control for Enterprise Systems",
      "product_description": "NameGuard helps IT admins and compliance teams block unauthorized access by checking user names against global deny lists and using AI to catch name variations. It\'s ideal for finance, defense, and critical infrastructure sectors needing strong security and compliance.",
      "implementation": "Use the patented method to integrate a name screening API into login or user registration flows. Names are matched against an updated denylist, decomposed, and analyzed via a neural network to detect obfuscated identities. Access decisions are then returned to the enterprise system.",
      "differentiation": "Unlike traditional DPL checks, NameGuard detects partial or altered name matches using name decomposition and machine learning. It adapts to evolving threats, aggregates multi-source deny lists, and flags suspect names not yet on known lists, reducing false negatives and increasing compliance accuracy."
    }
    Example 2:
    {
      "publication_number": "US-5644727-A",
      "title": "Amazon One-Click: Instant Purchase System for E-commerce",
      "product_description": "Amazon One-Click enables online shoppers to complete purchases with a single mouse click, eliminating the need to re-enter payment and shipping information. It serves busy consumers and mobile users who want frictionless checkout experiences, significantly reducing cart abandonment and increasing conversion rates for e-commerce platforms.",
      "implementation": "The system uses the patented single-action ordering method to securely store customer payment methods, shipping addresses, and preferences. When users click the One-Click button, the system automatically processes the order using pre-stored information, handles payment authorization, and initiates fulfillment without requiring additional user input or navigation through checkout pages.",
      "differentiation": "Unlike traditional multi-step checkout processes that require users to navigate through cart, billing, and shipping pages, One-Click ordering completes purchases instantly with minimal user effort. This dramatically reduces purchase friction, decreases abandonment rates, and creates a competitive advantage through superior user experience, particularly on mobile devices where lengthy checkout flows are especially cumbersome."
