  description: >
    Analyze the patent images for {publication_number}.
    You have a list of absolute image paths:

    {image_path_str}

    For each image path in the list: load and carefully examine the image using **VisionTool**.
    1. Identify domain-specific technical concepts from flowcharts, system architecture diagrams, and technical drawings.
    2. Keep track of entities and relationships between entities in the image.
    3. Append each image's analysis to the the result of the next image.
    
    You need to process ALL images! Do not quit early. Provide a comprehensive analysis of all visual elements from all images. 
    Output format: Valid JSON only, start with { and end with }.
