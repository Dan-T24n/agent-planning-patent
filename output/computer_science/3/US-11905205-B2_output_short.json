  "title": "FlatSeal: Precision-Engineered Chemically Strengthened Cover System",
  "product_description": "FlatSeal employs a dual ion-exchange process with exact material removal to form robust, flat sealing covers for smartphones, tablets, wearables, and automotive displays. It meets high standards for durability, water resistance, and optical clarity while streamlining production.",
  "implementation": "The system integrates a patented process with a cloud simulation platform. Finite element analysis and real-time sensor data power rapid prototyping, while machine learning refines the ion-exchange and material removal for accurate, iterative cover production.",
  "differentiation": "FlatSeal stands apart by embedding real-time computational modeling into production, drastically reducing trial-and-error and cutting costs. This agile method ensures high-performance covers with minimal complexity, offering a strong competitive edge."
