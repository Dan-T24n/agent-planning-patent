  "title": "DynaLink: Adaptive Hot-Plug Signal Correction for High-Speed Systems",
  "product_description": "DynaLink provides real-time signal correction in high-speed networks by auto-tuning parameters based on device ID. It targets data centers, telecom, automotive, and industrial sectors, ensuring plug-and-play setup with reduced downtime and enhanced performance.",
  "implementation": "DynaLink uses a dual-channel approach by merging high-speed data paths with a dedicated sideband control. When a device connects, its ID is retrieved, matched in a nonvolatile lookup table, and parameters are updated in real time for seamless operation.",
  "differentiation": "Unlike static systems, DynaLink employs adaptive algorithms that instantly update correction parameters via device diagnostics. This minimizes link training failures, reduces reconfiguration delays, and delivers robust plug-and-play performance."
