  "title": "ColoriCore POM Precision: Elevated Aesthetics & Performance for Advanced Applications",
  "product_description": "ColoriCore POM Precision is a high-performance colored polyoxymethylene copolymer built for automotive, consumer electronics, and medical devices. It offers consistent color, low formaldehyde emissions, and robust thermal and mechanical stability.",
  "implementation": "A patented process melts raw POM with colored particles, then passes the blend through sequential degassing chambers to remove monomers and stabilize the polymer. This continuous method ensures uniform color and high performance.",
  "differentiation": "Unlike conventional processes that result in uneven color and higher emissions, ColoriCore POM Precision\u2019s inline degassing system produces consistent, brilliant color with improved thermal stability and lower emissions, providing a strong competitive edge."
