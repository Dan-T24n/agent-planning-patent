  "title": "POMPro MIM Binder: Dual-Viscosity for Precision Metal Molding",
  "product_description": "POMPro MIM Binder is an advanced formulation blending high and low-viscosity POM polymers. Tailored for automotive, aerospace, and medical sectors, it boosts injection uniformity, speeds debinding, and minimizes defects for superior metal parts.",
  "implementation": "The binder is produced by mixing 10-50 wt% high-viscosity with 50-90 wt% low-viscosity POM under strict conditions. It is then incorporated in the metal injection process with rapid catalytic debinding and controlled sintering for optimal flow and density.",
  "differentiation": "POMPro MIM Binder stands out with its dual-viscosity blend that reduces polymer swelling, carbon buildup, and voids. This unique design ensures excellent injection flow, controlled debinding, and yields defect-free, high-density metal parts."
