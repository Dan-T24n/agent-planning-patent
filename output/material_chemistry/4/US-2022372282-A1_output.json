  "title": "POMPro MIM Binder: Dual-Viscosity Precision for Metal Injection Molding",
  "product_description": "POMPro MIM Binder is an advanced binder formulation utilizing a precise blend of high-viscosity and low-viscosity polyoxymethylene (POM) polymers. Designed for automotive, aerospace, and medical manufacturing sectors, it delivers enhanced injection uniformity, rapid debinding, and significant defect reduction for high-quality metal components.",
  "implementation": "Manufacturing involves the precise blending of 10-50 wt% high-viscosity and 50-90 wt% low-viscosity polyoxymethylene (POM) polymers under controlled conditions. The binder is integrated into the metal injection molding process with rapid catalytic debinding and controlled sintering to achieve optimal flow and density.",
  "differentiation": "POMPro MIM Binder stands apart with its innovative dual-viscosity approach that minimizes polymer swelling, carbon buildup, and void formation. This unique formulation ensures superior injection flow and controlled debinding, resulting in defect-free, high-density metal parts with reliable performance."
