  "title": "ThermoGuard POM-X: High-Performance POM with Modified SMA for Advanced Engineering",
  "product_description": "ThermoGuard POM-X is an advanced polyoxymethylene (POM) blend enhanced with modified styrene-maleic anhydride (SMA) copolymers to achieve heat deflection above 100Â°C, improved creep resistance, and consistent melt viscosity. Designed for automotive, electronics, aerospace, and industrial sectors, it ensures prolonged durability under thermal and mechanical stresses.",
  "implementation": "The material is produced via a controlled melt blending process that combines high-grade polyoxymethylene with 1-20% modified styrene-maleic anhydride copolymers and select additives. Precision molding ensures uniform dispersion, enabling integration into complex parts with maintained thermal and mechanical performance.",
  "differentiation": "Unlike conventional formulations relying on heavy fillers, ThermoGuard POM-X uniquely employs chemically modified styrene-maleic anhydride copolymers to lower acid values and enhance performance. This strategy results in superior heat deflection, reduced creep, consistent viscosity retention, and a lighter material for demanding applications."
