  "title": "ThermoGuard POM-X: Advanced POM with Modified SMA for Next-Gen Engineering",
  "product_description": "ThermoGuard POM-X is an advanced POM blend enhanced with modified SMA copolymers, delivering heat deflection over 100\u00b0C, improved creep resistance, and stable melt viscosity. It\u2019s ideal for automotive, electronics, aerospace, and industrial uses, ensuring lasting durability.",
  "implementation": "Manufactured via controlled melt blending, high-grade POM is mixed with 1-20% modified SMA copolymers and selected additives. Precision molding achieves uniform dispersion, ensuring the composite\u2019s thermal and mechanical performance in complex parts.",
  "differentiation": "Unlike filler-heavy formulations, ThermoGuard POM-X uses chemically modified SMA copolymers to lower acid levels and boost performance. This results in superior heat deflection, less creep, consistent viscosity, and a lighter material for demanding applications."
