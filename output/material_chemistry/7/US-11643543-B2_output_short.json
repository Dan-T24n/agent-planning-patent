  "title": "EcoShield Trim: Advanced Low-Emission Polyacetal Resin for Auto Interiors",
  "product_description": "EcoShield Trim is a low-emission polyacetal resin for automotive interiors. Targeting car makers and design engineers, it offers high gloss, improved weather resistance, and reduced formaldehyde emissions for enhanced safety and visual appeal.",
  "implementation": "Using lean melt-kneading (a thermomechanical process), EcoShield Trim is made into uniform resin pellets with precise aluminum pigment dispersion. This careful process minimizes defects and supports rapid scale-up for a just-in-time injection molding supply chain.",
  "differentiation": "EcoShield Trim stands out with scalable, cost-effective production that cuts the need for extra surface treatments while delivering superior aesthetics. Its innovative process lowers environmental impact and meets strict safety standards, giving auto interiors a competitive edge."
