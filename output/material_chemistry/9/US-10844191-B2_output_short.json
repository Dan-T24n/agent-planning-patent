  "title": "AcidShield Polyacetal: Advanced Resin for Extreme Chemical Durability",
  "product_description": "AcidShield Polyacetal is a high-performance resin designed for extreme chemical durability in harsh acid environments. It targets design engineers and industrial experts, offering extended lifespan, low maintenance, and reliable performance under severe chemical stress.",
  "implementation": "The resin is produced by polymerizing a custom polyacetal copolymer with terminal groups below 0.8 mmol/kg, then blending with hindered phenol antioxidants and high-surface magnesium oxide. It is molded via standard methods and verified using FTIR, DSC, and tensile tests.",
  "differentiation": "AcidShield Polyacetal is distinct due to its precise terminal group control, allowing higher magnesium oxide loading without affecting moldability. This formulation delivers superior acid resistance and durability, giving a competitive edge in extreme chemical settings."
