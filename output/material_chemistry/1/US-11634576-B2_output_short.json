  "title": "AcidGuard Polyacetal: Advanced Acid-Resistant Resin for Automotive & Industrial Innovation",
  "product_description": "AcidGuard Polyacetal is an advanced resin blend based on a low hemiformal polyacetal, enhanced with a hindered phenol antioxidant (HPA) and magnesium oxide. It offers robust acid resistance, lasting durability, and reliable performance in demanding automotive, lab, and industrial settings.",
  "implementation": "The process uses precision thermal molding to blend low hemiformal polyacetal with exact amounts of HPA and magnesium oxide. Advanced tests like FTIR, DSC, and SEM ensure uniform composition and strong acid resistance throughout production.",
  "differentiation": "AcidGuard Polyacetal stands out with its unique formula that minimizes degradation from acidic cleaners. Its tailored polyacetal structure with HPA and magnesium oxide provides superior chemical stability, high thermal endurance, and less mold buildup than typical resins."
