- **Output**: JSON product concept following standardized format


## Phase 4: Concept Evaluation with Voting System

### Three-Evaluator Framework

Each evaluator scores all concepts using the standardized 6-criteria framework (1-5 scale), then selects their top choice and suggests 1 critical improvement.

#### VC Partner Evaluator
- **Expertise**: Market sizing, competitive moats, portfolio fit
- **Perspective**: Investment scalability, market timing, financial returns
- **Selection Criteria**: Would invest $10M+ Series A in this concept

#### Tech CEO Evaluator  
- **Expertise**: Engineering execution, product-market fit, go-to-market
- **Perspective**: Product execution, technical feasibility, operational scaling
- **Selection Criteria**: Would build and scale this with engineering team

#### Research Entrepreneur Evaluator
- **Expertise**: Technology transfer, successful implementation, technological breakthroughs  
- **Perspective**: Research commercialization, innovation-market bridge
- **Selection Criteria**: Successfully bridges research breakthrough with business opportunity

### Voting Process

**Step 1: Individual Evaluation**
- Each evaluator scores all concepts on 6 criteria
- Each evaluator selects their single preferred concept
- Each evaluator identifies 1 critical improvement for their selected concept

**Step 2: Vote Tallying**
- 3/3 Unanimous: HIGH CONFIDENCE
- 2/1 Majority: MEDIUM-HIGH CONFIDENCE  
- 1/1/1 Tie: Requires tie-breaking by Managing Partner

**Step 3: Concept Refinement**
- Collect improvement suggestions from all evaluators
- Apply relevant improvements to winning concept
- Maintain core value proposition while addressing critical gaps

**Step 4: Final Decision**
- Successful VC Managing Partner makes final call
- Integrates evaluator feedback into refined concept
- Provides implementation roadmap with enhanced features

### Critical Validation Dimensions

**1. Technical Validity**
- Can the patent technology actually deliver the promised functionality?
- Are there any fundamental technical barriers or missing components?
- Can this be built within 3 years?
- *Red Flags: Patent is too theoretical, requires unproven materials, needs breakthrough advances*

**2. Innovativeness**
- How novel is this solution compared to existing alternatives?
- Does this represent a breakthrough or incremental improvement?
- Does the patented technology offer genuinely novel solutions?

**3. Specificity**
- Is the product concept clearly defined with specific features?
- Are target customers and use cases precisely identified?
- Is there a clear path from patent to product features?

**4. Need Validity**
- Have you validated that this addresses real user problems?
- Are users currently paying for inadequate solutions or doing manual workarounds?
- Would users pay premium pricing for this solution?
- *Red Flags: Users say "nice to have," existing solutions work well enough*

**5. Market Size**
- Are there >$100M potential volume globally?
- Is the addressable market growing >10% annually?
- Can you reach break-even with <5% market penetration?
- *Red Flags: Niche market <100K users, declining industry*

**6. Competitive Advantage**
- Would it take competitors 2+ years to develop a workaround?
- Does the patent create a meaningful performance difference users will notice?
- Are there additional patents or trade secrets that strengthen the moat?
- *Red Flags: Easy workarounds exist, advantage is marginal*

### Streamlined Scoring Process

**Decision Rule:** Concepts need 4+ average score AND no individual criterion below 3 to proceed

---

## Success Criteria Scoring (1-5 scale)

Each criterion is rated from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest):

- **Technical Validity**: Is the patent suitable for the product? Is implementation feasible within 3 years?
- **Innovativeness**: Does the patented technology offer a novel solution to market demand?
- **Specificity**: Is the product concept clearly defined with specific features and target users?
- **Need Validity**: Do the described users really need this solution?
- **Market Size**: Is the addressable market large enough with sufficient potential users?
- **Competitive Advantage**: What business advantage does the product gain from this patented technology?

**Final Score = Average of all six criteria scores**
