## Evaluator Framework

### Standardized 6-Criteria Evaluation
All evaluators use identical scoring framework from eval.md (1-5 scale with detailed guidelines):

1. **Technical Validity**: Assessment of whether the patented technology can be practically implemented within realistic constraints (1-3 years)
2. **Innovativeness**: Evaluation of how novel and differentiated the patented technology is compared to existing solutions
3. **Specificity**: Assessment of how clearly defined and focused the patent application is in terms of target users and use cases
4. **Need Validity**: Verification that target users have a genuine, pressing need for the solution described in the patent
5. **Market Size**: Assessment of the total addressable market and potential user base for the patented technology
6. **Competitive Advantage**: Evaluation of strategic business benefits and differentiation the patent provides vs competitors

Each criterion follows detailed scoring guidelines:
- **5 - Excellent/Breakthrough**: Highest level achievement in this dimension
- **4 - Good/Strong**: Above average performance with clear benefits
- **3 - Average/Moderate**: Adequate performance meeting basic requirements
- **2 - Poor/Weak**: Below average with significant concerns
- **1 - Unacceptable/No benefit**: Fails to meet minimum standards

### Evaluator Perspectives

#### VC Partner Evaluator
- **Expertise**: Market sizing, competitive moats, portfolio fit
- **Selection Criteria**: Would invest $10M+ Series A in this concept

#### Tech CEO Evaluator  
- **Expertise**: Engineering execution, product-market fit, go-to-market

#### Research Entrepreneur Evaluator
- **Expertise**: Technology transfer, successful implementation, technological breakthroughs  
- **Perspective**: Research commercialization, innovation-market bridge
- **Selection Criteria**: Successfully bridges research breakthrough with business opportunity

## Voting System with Concept Refinement

### Step 1: Individual Evaluation & Selection
- Each evaluator scores all concepts on 6 criteria
- Each evaluator selects their top choice
- Each evaluator identifies 1 critical improvement for their selected concept

### Step 2: Vote Tallying
```
Voting Outcomes:
- 3/3 Unanimous: HIGH CONFIDENCE
- 2/1 Majority: MEDIUM-HIGH CONFIDENCE  
- 1/1/1 Tie: LOW CONFIDENCE -> choose the project with highest overal score
```

### Step 3: Concept Refinement (Successful VC Managing Partner)
- Apply improvement suggestions from evaluators
- Focus on suggestions for winning concept
- Integrate feedback that strengthens competitive position
- Maintain core value proposition while addressing gaps
- Make tie-breaking decisions when evaluators select different concepts

### Step 4: Final Enhanced Product Concept
```yaml
Output Structure:
- winning_concept: Original concept with majority votes
- vote_breakdown: Which evaluator voted for which concept
- improvement_suggestions: Critical improvements from all evaluators
- refined_concept: Enhanced version incorporating relevant feedback
- implementation_roadmap: Next steps with integrated improvements  
- confidence_level: Based on vote distribution and evaluator agreement
```
