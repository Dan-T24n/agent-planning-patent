# Patent Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Technical Validity
**Definition**: Assessment of whether the patented technology can be practically implemented for the intended product within realistic constraints.

**Evaluation Guidelines**:
- Examine the technical specifications and requirements outlined in the patent
- Consider current technological capabilities and infrastructure needed
- Assess resource requirements (development time, expertise, equipment)
- Evaluate potential technical risks and implementation challenges
- Consider scalability and maintainability of the proposed solution

**Scoring Scale (1-5)**:
- **5 - Excellent**: Technology is proven, well-documented, and can be implemented within 1-2 years with existing resources
- **4 - Good**: Implementation is feasible within 2-3 years with moderate technical challenges
- **3 - Average**: Requires significant development effort but achievable within 3 years with proper resources
- **2 - Poor**: Major technical hurdles exist; implementation uncertain within 3-year timeframe
- **1 - Unacceptable**: Technology is not feasible with current capabilities or timeline

## 2. Innovativeness
**Definition**: Evaluation of how novel and differentiated the patented technology is compared to existing solutions in the market.

**Evaluation Guidelines**:
- Research existing solutions and competitors in the same space
- Identify unique aspects of the patented approach
- Assess whether the innovation solves problems in a fundamentally new way
- Consider the degree of improvement over current alternatives
- Evaluate potential for creating new market categories or disrupting existing ones

**Scoring Scale (1-5)**:
- **5 - Breakthrough**: Represents a paradigm shift with no comparable existing solutions
- **4 - Highly Innovative**: Significant novel approach with clear differentiation from competitors
- **3 - Moderately Innovative**: Some novel elements but builds on existing concepts
- **2 - Incremental**: Minor improvements over existing solutions
- **1 - Not Innovative**: Concept already widely available or implemented

## 3. Specificity
**Definition**: Assessment of how clearly defined and focused the patent application is in terms of target users, use cases, and problem being solved.

**Evaluation Guidelines**:
- Examine clarity of problem definition and target audience
- Assess specificity of use cases and implementation scenarios
- Evaluate whether the patent addresses a well-defined pain point
- Consider measurability of the proposed solution's impact
- Review precision of technical claims and boundaries

**Scoring Scale (1-5)**:
- **5 - Highly Specific**: Clearly defined problem, target users, and specific use cases with measurable outcomes
- **4 - Well-Defined**: Good specificity with minor ambiguities in scope or application
- **3 - Adequately Specific**: Reasonably clear but could benefit from more precise definition
- **2 - Vague**: Broad or unclear problem definition with ambiguous target applications
- **1 - Too General**: Overly broad scope that lacks focus and clear direction

## 4. Need Validity
**Definition**: Verification that the target users have a genuine, pressing need for the solution described in the patent.

**Evaluation Guidelines**:
- Conduct user research or analyze existing market data
- Assess pain point severity and frequency among target users
- Evaluate current workarounds or solutions users employ
- Consider user willingness to adopt new solutions
- Analyze feedback from potential users or similar products

**Scoring Scale (1-5)**:
- **5 - Critical Need**: Urgent, widespread problem that users actively seek solutions for
- **4 - Strong Need**: Clear user pain point with demonstrated demand for solutions
- **3 - Moderate Need**: Users acknowledge the problem but may not prioritize solving it
- **2 - Weak Need**: Limited evidence of user demand or minor inconvenience
- **1 - No Clear Need**: Users don't recognize the problem or have adequate existing solutions

## 5. Market Size
**Definition**: Assessment of the total addressable market and potential user base for the patented technology.

**Evaluation Guidelines**:
- Estimate total addressable market (TAM) and serviceable addressable market (SAM)
- Analyze target demographic size and growth trends
- Consider geographic reach and expansion potential
- Evaluate market maturity and adoption rates
- Assess barriers to market entry and penetration

**Scoring Scale (1-5)**:
- **5 - Large Market**: TAM >$1B with strong growth potential and broad user base
- **4 - Substantial Market**: TAM $100M-$1B with good growth prospects
- **3 - Moderate Market**: TAM $10M-$100M with steady demand
- **2 - Small Market**: TAM $1M-$10M with limited growth potential
- **1 - Niche Market**: TAM <$1M with very limited user base

## 6. Competitive Advantage
**Definition**: Evaluation of the strategic business benefits and differentiation the patent provides compared to competitors.

**Evaluation Guidelines**:
- Identify direct and indirect competitors in the market
- Analyze competitive positioning and differentiation opportunities
- Assess barriers to entry the patent creates for competitors
- Consider licensing potential and IP protection strength
- Evaluate long-term sustainability of competitive advantages

**Scoring Scale (1-5)**:
- **5 - Dominant Advantage**: Patent creates significant barriers to entry with strong, defensible market position
- **4 - Strong Advantage**: Clear competitive differentiation with good IP protection
- **3 - Moderate Advantage**: Some competitive benefits but competitors could develop alternatives
- **2 - Weak Advantage**: Limited differentiation with easy competitive responses
- **1 - No Advantage**: Patent provides no meaningful competitive benefit over existing solutions

## Evaluation Instructions
1. **Score each criterion independently** on the 1-5 scale provided
2. **Provide specific evidence** and reasoning for each score
3. **Document assumptions** made during evaluation
4. **Calculate weighted average** if certain criteria are more important for your specific use case
5. **Include recommendations** based on overall scoring patterns
6. **Review scores collectively** to ensure consistency and identify potential conflicts between criteria
